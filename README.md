> Stay wet, stay wild, with AquaMinder by your side!

AquaMinder is a simple yet powerful notification system that reminds you
to drink your big chonky glass of water at regular intervals! 
Right now the interval is set at 15 minutes, the plan is to make it customizable (PRs are very welcome).

(definitely not a logo made with Paint BTW)
